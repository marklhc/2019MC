# Why Do We Do Statistics?

- To study some target quantities in the population
    * Based on a limited sample
- How do we know that a statistics/statistical method gets us to a reasonable answer?
    * Analytic reasoning
    * Simulation

# What is MC (in Statistics)?

- Simulate the _process of repeated random sampling_
    * E.g., repeatedly drawing sample of IQ scores of size 10 from a population
- Approximate _sampling distributions_
    * Using __pseudorandom samples__
- Study properties of __estimators__
    * regression coefficients, fit index
    * compare multiple estimators or modeling approaches

---

# What is it (cont'd)?

- Based on Carsey & Harden (2014):
    * Simulations as experiments
        * Whether there's a "treatment" effect (but not why)
    * Simulations help develop intuition
        * Shouldn't replace analytically and theoretical reasoning 
    * Simulations help evaluate substantive theories and empirical results

???

Sometimes analytic solution does not exist

# Generating Random Data in R

With MC, one simulates the process of generating the data with an assumed 
__data generating model__

- Model: including both functional form and distributional assumptions

.font80[
```{r rnorm}
rnorm(5, mean = 0, sd = 1)
rnorm(5, mean = 0, sd = 1)  # numbers changed
```
]

---

# Setting the Seed

- Most programs use algorithms to generate numbers that look like random
    * _pseudorandom_
    * Completely determined by the _seed_
- For replicability, <font color="red">__ALWAYS__</font> explicitly set the seed
in the beginning

.font80[
```{r seed}
set.seed(1)
rnorm(5, mean = 0, sd = 1)
set.seed(1)
rnorm(5, mean = 0, sd = 1)  # same seed, same numbers
```
]

---

# Generating Data From Univariate Distributions

```{r, eval=FALSE}
rnorm(n, mean, sd)      # Normal distribution (mean and SD)
runif(n, min, max)      # Uniform distribution (minimum and maximum)
rchisq(n, df)           # Chi-squared distribution (degrees of freedom)
rbinom(n, size, prob)   # Binomial distribution
```

???

Other distributions include `exponential`, `gamma`, `beta`, `t`, `F`

# Parameter vs Estimator

- __Estimator__/statistic: $T(\mathbf{X})$, or simply $T$
    * How good does it estimate the population parameter, $\theta$?
- Examples:
    * $T = \bar{X}$ estimates $\theta = \mu$
    * $T = \dfrac{\sum_i (X_i - \bar{X})^2}{N - 1}$ estimates $\theta = \sigma^2$

# Properties of Estimators

- Bias
- Consistency
- Efficiency
- Robustness

# Sampling Distribution

sample_size <- 10  # define sample size
# Initialize place holders for results

for (i in seq_len(NREP)) {
  sam_means[i] <- mean(rchisq(sample_size, df = 4))

# When to use MC?

- When it's difficult to analytically derive the sampling distribution
    * E.g., indirect effect, fit-indexes; Cohen's $d$, *SE*s of estimators
- When required assumptions are violated
    * E.g., normality, large sample
    * Model is misspecified
    * Used to check __robustness__ of the estimator

# Design

Like experimental designs, conditions should be carefully chosen
- What to manipulate? Sample size? Effect size? Why?
    * Based on statistical theory and reasoning
    * E.g., Gauss-Markov theorem: regression coefficients are unbiased with 
    violations of distributional assumptions
- What levels? Why?
    * Needs to be realistic for empirical research
    * Maybe based on previous systematic reviews, 
    * Or a small review of your own
    
---

# Design (cont'd)

Full Factorial designs are most commonly used

Other alternatives include fractional factorial, random levels, etc
- See `r Citet(myBib, "skrondal2000")` for why they should be used more often

---

# Generate

- Starts with a statistical data generating model
    * E.g., $Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + e_i,\quad e_i \overset{\textrm{i.i.d.}}{\sim} N(0, \sigma^2)$
        + Systematic (deterministic) component: $X_i$
        + Random (stochastic) component: $e_i$
        + Constants (parameters): $\beta_0$, $\beta_1$
    * $Y_i$ completely determined by $X_i, e_i, \beta_0, \beta_1$
    
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=3.5}
DiagrammeR::grViz("
digraph reg {

  # a 'graph' statement
  graph [overlap = true, fontsize = 10]

  # several 'node' statements

# Analyze

Analyze the simulated data using one or more analytic approaches
- Misspecification: study the impact when analytic model omits important aspects of data generating model
    * E.g., ignoring clustering
- Comparison of approaches
    * E.g., Maximum likelihood vs. multiple imputation for missing data handling

---

# Summarize (Evaluation Criteria)

- $\bar{\hat \theta}$ = $\sum_{i = 1}^R \hat \theta_i / R$
- $\hat{\mathit{SD}}(\hat \theta)$ = 
  $\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i = 1}^R (\theta_i - \bar{\hat \theta})^2}{R}}$

For evaluating estimators:

- Bias
    * Raw: $\bar{\hat \theta} - \theta$
    * Relative: Bias / $\theta$
    * Standardized: Bias / $\hat{\mathit{SD}}(\hat \theta)$
- Relative efficiency (only for unbiased estimators)
    * $\mathrm{RE}(\hat \theta, \tilde \theta)$ = $\frac{\hat{\mathrm{Var}}(\tilde \theta)}{\hat{\mathrm{Var}}(\hat \theta)}$

---

# Evaluation Criteria (cont'd)

For uncertainty estimators

- SE bias
    * Raw: $\overline{\mathit{SE}(\hat \theta)} - \hat{\mathit{SD}}(\hat \theta)$
    * Relative: SE bias / $\hat{\mathit{SD}}(\hat \theta)$

Combining bias and efficiency

- Mean squared error (MSE): $\frac{\sum_{i = 1}^R (\theta_i - \theta)^2}{R}$
    * Also = $\mathrm{Bias}^2 + \hat{\mathrm{Var}}(\hat \theta)$
    * Root MSE (RMSE) = $\sqrt{\mathrm{MSE}}$
- Mainly to compare 2+ estimators

---

# Evaluation Criteria (cont'd)

For statistical inferences:

- Power/Empirical Type I error rates
    * % with $p < \alpha$ (usually $\alpha$ = .05)
- Coverage of $C$% CI (e.g., $C$ = 95%)
    * % where the sample CI contains $\theta$

# Number of Replications

Should be justified rather than relying on rule of thumbs

## Why Does MC Work?

- Law of large number
    * $\sum_{i = 1}^R T_i / R \overset{p}{\to} \theta$
- When $R$ is large, 
    + the empirical distribution $\hat{F}(t)$ converges to the true sampling distribution $F(t)$. 

---

# Number of Replications (cont'd)

## How Good is the Approximation

- Monte Carlo (MC) Error 
    * Like standard error (SE) for a point estimate
- For expectations (e.g., bias)
    * MC Error = $\hat{\mathit{SD}}(\hat \theta) / \sqrt{R}$

E.g., if one wants the MC error to be ≤2.5% of the sampling variability, 
_R_ needs to be 1 / $.025^2$ = 1,600

---

# Number of Replications (cont'd)

For power (also Type I error) and CI coverage, 
* MC Error = $\sqrt{\frac{p (1 - p)}{R}}$

E.g., with _R_ = 250, and empirical Type I error = 5%, 
```{r}
sqrt((.05 * (1 - .05)) / 250)
```
So _R_ should be increase for more precise estimates
